# üåê Access Home Assistant Remotely via Cloudflare Tunnel

This guide will walk you through the steps required to securely access your Home Assistant instance remotely using Cloudflare Tunnel. You'll need a domain (either paid or free) to complete the setup.

## üîß Prerequisites:
- A domain name (can be a paid or free domain).
- Home Assistant running on your local network.
- Cloudflare account and Cloudflare Tunnel setup.
- Setting up Cloudflare Tunnel https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up:

### 1. **Prepare Your Domain with Cloudflare:**
   - Sign up for a Cloudflare account if you don't have one.
   - If your domain is not provided by CloudFlare, you can transfer it. To transfer your domain to Cloudflare. See https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/

### 2. **Update Home Assistant Configuration:**
   - Open your `configuration.yaml` file located in your Home Assistant configuration folder.
   - Add the following configuration under:

   ```yaml
   # Cloudflare remote access
http:
  # Enable support for the X-Forwarded-For header to track the original IP address of requests.
  use_x_forwarded_for: true

  # Define trusted proxies. This ensures that only requests coming from the specified IP range are allowed.
  # This IP range is typically used by the Cloudflare Tunnel add-on.
  trusted_proxies:
    - 172.30.33.0/24  # The IP range used by the Cloudflare Tunnel to securely forward traffic to your Home Assistant instance

```


### 3. Install Cloudflare Add-On in Home Assistant:
1. Go to **Add-ons** > **Add-on Store** in Home Assistant.
2. Click on the three dots menu (top-right corner) and select **Repositories** > **Add New**.
3. Paste the following URL into the repository field:

   ```text
   https://github.com/brenner-tobias/ha-addons
   ```
4. Once added, search for the Cloudflare Tunnel add-on and click Install.

 ### 4. Configure the Cloudflare Add-On:
1. Go to **Configurations** within the **Cloudflare Tunnel** add-on.
2. Add your external domain in the **External Domain** field.

   **Tip:** It's recommended to create a subdomain for this purpose (e.g., `hahome.example.net`). This allows automatic identification on Cloudflare tunnels and provides a clean URL for accessing Home Assistant externally.

Enjoy secure remote access to your Home Assistant instance!

## üîí Security Considerations:
- **HTTPS:** Ensure your Cloudflare Tunnel is using HTTPS to secure the connection.
- **Authentication:** Set up authentication methods for your Home Assistant instance (e.g., long-lived access tokens) to restrict unauthorized access.
- **Firewalls & Restrictions:** Make sure to configure your firewall to only allow access to the necessary ports and services.
